# BrainBoard

## Overview
This project explores the development of a BCI-powered keyboard, leveraging NextMind's Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology. The BCI keyboard enables users to type with unprecedented speed and accuracy by directly translating their brain signals into text input.

##  Motivation
Once __Elon Musk__ said-”Drug dealers know more about running a business than 95% of business professors.” Following Breaking Bad scene is the inspiration for the BrainBoard BCI Keyboard.
